7,Webs,Each surface is populated with spiders who have called this room home. The spiders have congregated to cover floor ceiling and walls in a rich expanse of webbing.,15
8,Mists From the Walls,An obscuring mist floats off the walls clothing every entity in the room-from the chairs to the shadows.,15
9,Something Slimy,The ceiling drips with a deep green slime. With each drip onto the ground it burns deeper into the floor. Above-head: a drop begins its descent.,15
10,Disquieting Sounds,A wail echoes through the room. It originates from nothing and yet everything.,15

12,The Voice,A quiet voice whispers from the shadows on the walls: words of agony and despair. The voice mocks all who unwisely enter into the deep recesses of the house.,15
13,Burning Man,A screaming voice erupts from inside a flame in middle of the room. Requests for death are unmet as the flesh of the burning man heals only to burn and slough off again.,15

24,The Walls,The room is calm... The sound of grinding stone resounding from opposing walls belies its agenda as the walls approach each other.,15
